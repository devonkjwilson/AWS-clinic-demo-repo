# AWS-clinic-demo-repo
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an end-to-end healthcare operations analytics platform built on AWS. The system ingests operational clinic data from an API, processes it through a medallion-style architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and serves curated datasets to a warehouse for reporting and analytics.
